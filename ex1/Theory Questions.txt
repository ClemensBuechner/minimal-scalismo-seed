3.1 a)
Smaller, as the scaling would represent another dimension of variability.

3.1 b)
Variability in shapes decreases as we use less shapes in our model. We can no longer differentiate between shapes of left and right hans.

3.2
The points lie in a straight line. This is because the rank of the covariance matrix is 1, meaning all Eigenvectors point in the same direction.

3.3
We sum over z*z' which is a matrix of rank 1, leading to a rank n matrix. However, as the sum has to be 0 (constraint given by the covariance), one is linearly dependant. Therefore, the overall rank of the resulting matrix is n-1.

3.4
This would be sufficient.
