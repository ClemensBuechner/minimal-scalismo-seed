Part of the statistical shape modelling course on Future Learn is the challenge to reconstruct femur bones from partial data using given training data. This problem has widespread real world applications in the medical field. While the procedure itself is straightforward, obtaining a good model to predict the reconstructions with a high accuracy can be challenging. In the following, we will present our strategies, struggles and solutions for this problem.
