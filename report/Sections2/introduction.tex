\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Locating objects and boundaries in an image is called image segmentation.
Medical institutions use it for diagnosing internal diseases (\eg, locating tumors) on CT or MRI images.
Analyzing such images by hand is very costly and requires expert knowledge.
Automating the task could reduce expenses and save time and resources.

In this project, we implemented such an algorithm to fit a femur model to 3-D CT images.
The approach works with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample model instances.
The quality of the samples subject to the image is then evaluated using Active Shape Models (ASM).
In the end, the sample which fits the data best is chosen as shape estimate of the scanned bone.
